# Single-Channel-Speech-Enhancement-Based-On-DNN
Use DNN to estimate the phase information of the speech in STFT filed to improve the speech quality and intelligibility.

DNN_sim.zip is the Matlab code


The demo package contains the wav demo generated by the DNN models and BLSTM models

Example 1. using TIMIT corpurs. 
A. Factory1 noise, SNR=0dB, female speakers (“She had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year.“)

B. Bucanner1 noise, SNR=-3dB, female speakers (“She had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year.“)

C. Babble noise, SNR=0 dB, male speakers  (“Don’t ask me to carry an oily rag like that.“)

D. Babble noise, SNR=-5 dB, male speakers  (“But even mother’s loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior.“)

E. Destoryoper noise (unknown) , SNR=-3 dB, both genders  (“She had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year.“)


Example 2. using CHiME-4 corpurs (simulated data). 
% the training and test data informaiton of our experiment can be referred to [training and test information] [tr05_simu]

A. CHiME-4, using mask approximation (MA) loss function

B. CHiME-4, SNR=-3 dB, using mask approximation +masked signal approximation (MA+mSA) loss function
